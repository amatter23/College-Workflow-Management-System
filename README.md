# College Workflow Management System (Front-End)

## Introduction

The College Workflow Management System (CWMS) is a web-based platform engineered to enhance communication, task delegation, progress monitoring, and feedback sharing across various faculty roles within an educational institution. By transitioning from traditional, paper-dependent systems that were prone to errors and inefficiencies, CWMS offers a digital solution to optimize workflow, foster collaboration, and elevate overall productivity.

## Overview

This front-end part of CWMS is developed to:
- Facilitate a hierarchy of roles: Dean, Vice Dean, Heads of Department, Doctors, and Assistant Doctors, each with distinct permissions and responsibilities.
- Provide a dedicated communication channel for the Secretary with the Dean.
- Offer a straightforward vacation request workflow, streamlining the approval process across the user hierarchy.
- Present a user-centric dashboard for each role, highlighting tasks assigned and their progress.

## Problem Definition

The absence of a cohesive digital system in colleges has often led to workflow disruptions, miscommunication, and a lack of transparency. CWMS aims to address these challenges, transforming task management and vacation approval processes into a seamless digital experience.

## Challenges

The implementation of CWMS faces several challenges, including:
- User adaptation to new digital workflows.
- Ensuring top-tier data security and safeguarding sensitive information.
- Seamless integration with existing institutional databases.
- Guaranteeing scalability to accommodate the growth of the institution.
- Implementing robust data backup and recovery mechanisms.
- Providing efficient technical support and system maintenance.

## Objectives

CWMS's core objectives encapsulate:
- Centralizing task management processes.
- Streamlining task allocation and tracking.
- Facilitating efficient feedback exchange among faculty.
- Supporting hierarchical management with task delegation and feedback mechanisms.
- Enhancing task visibility with real-time notifications.
- Managing user accounts effectively, with the added provision of a System Administrator role.
